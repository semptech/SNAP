SNAP – The Next Generation Visual Application Platform

SNAP’s visual development approach allows for the creation of beautiful, modern, responsive Enterprise Grade business applications up to 10 times faster than traditional manual coding. Create the next generation of software developers in your team in no time at all.

Key Features:

-	Visual, drag and drop development experience

-	Rapid creation of responsive apps for mobile and web

-	Does not require in-depth coding knowledge or experience

-	Fast rapid lean start-up	-	Design thinking through prototyping

-	Automatic generation of HTML5, JavaScript and PHP code

-	Cloud or on-premise platform

-	Integration using Web Service and RESTful API’s

SNAP is designed for enterprises that want to continuously innovate their digital business operations to keep up with ever changing customer expectations in today’s dynamic and rapidly changing business environment.

Many IT organisations are failing to keep up with the demand for new mobile and digital applications from their business users because the established approach to software development is time consuming and expensive.



What is SNAP?

SNAP is a new agile approach to software development that helps businesses to accelerate their digital transformation through non-stop application design, innovation and delivery at speed.

SNAP is the next generation visual application platform which is purpose built to enable the rapid creation and deployment of modern, responsive digital business applications without the need to resort to traditional manual coding or the inevitable scheduling and cost uncertainties of traditional IT projects.

SNAP users can now build modern, responsive business applications for any device, whether Windows, Mac, iOS or Android, up to 10 times faster than before compared to a manual coding approach. 



Key Business Benefits:

-	Accelerate continuous innovation up to 10 times faster

-	Collaboration gets the UI right first time

-	From design to deploy in a single step on the same platform	-	Unify disparate back end data stores into a single digital experience

-	Respond rapidly to changing customer needs

-	Thrive in today’s dynamic digital business environment



Visual development approach

SNAP’s visual development approach allows business users and IT personnel to collaborate together to visually design business applications, whilst production quality HTML5, JavaScript and PHP code is generated automatically from pre-built blocks of open source code based on a concept created by Google and MIT.

SNAP users create the visual UI design by ‘dragging and dropping’ these easy-to-understand pre-built code blocks, which eliminates coding and syntax errors and means users do not have to have in-depth coding experience or knowledge of traditional coding methodologies.

Enterprise grade production code is generated automatically in the background providing a fully working business application in a single step, removing the need to pass designs between business users, to business analysts, to programmers, to testing and backward and forward between the different groups.

This collapses the traditional development lifecycle dramatically enabling Enterprise Grade production code to be built in a fraction of the time and cost when compared to existing development methodologies and the manual coding approach.

Simple integration with back-end systems

Integration with existing back end systems is handled by loading existing SOAP Web Services and REST API’s as WSDL’s (Web Service Definition Language) into the SNAP repository.

Our customers are able to innovate rapidly by building new digital front-end applications, unifying their existing disparate data stores and back-end applications to provide a seamless digital experience for their customers, employees and partners.

Design and change applications faster, create beautiful user experiences, lower development and innovation costs, with highly secure, highly scalable SNAP applications.
